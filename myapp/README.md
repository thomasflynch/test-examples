dashboard issues
Direct HTTP Calls in Component: The component is directly making HTTP calls, which should be separated into a service.
Use of any Type: The data structure lacks a defined type, leading to a lack of type safety.
Lifecycle Hook for Data Loading: Data loading in the constructor is not a recommended practice.
Lack of Loading Indicator: There's no indication to the user when data is being loaded.
Hard-Coded API URL: The API URL is directly embedded in the component.
No Error Handling: There is no error handling for the HTTP request.
Lack of Unit Testability: Direct HTTP calls in the component make it hard to unit test.
Template Responsiveness: The template does not consider responsive design.
Use of Inline Template for Complexity: The inline template can become unwieldy as complexity grows.
Accessibility Features Missing: The template lacks proper accessibility features.

improvements
Service-Based Architecture: Moved HTTP logic to a separate DataService.
Type Safety Enhanced: Defined a DataItem model for the data structure.
Init Data Load: Moved data loading to ngOnInit for better lifecycle management.
Loading Indicator Added: Included a loading state indicator in the template.
Configurable API URL: Moved the API URL to the service for better configuration.
Error Handling: Added error handling logic in the data fetching method.
Improved Testability: Separating concerns improves the unit testability of the component.
Responsive Design Consideration: Using a separate HTML file allows for easier integration of responsive design.
External Template for Complexity: Moved the template to an external file for better maintainability.
Accessibility Enhancement: An external template file allows for adding accessibility features more effectively.
